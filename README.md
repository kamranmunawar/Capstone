# Capstone Bayesian Optimization
This project focuses on black-box optimization, specifically targeting the optimization of eight different types of black box functions. To accomplish this, I employ Bayesian optimization techniques, utilizing the GaussianProcessRegressor and botorch.acquisition modules. These tools help me efficiently explore and exploit the search space, ultimately improving the performance of the black box functions.
